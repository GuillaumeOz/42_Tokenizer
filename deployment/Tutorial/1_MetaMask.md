### 1. Install MetaMask

When we deploy a smart contract to the blockchain or make a transaction to the deployed smart contract,
we need to pay the gas fee, and for that, we need to have a Web3 wallet, which is MetaMask. 
So, first of all, we'll install MetaMask.

Please click [here](https://metamask.io/) to install MetaMask;
meanwhile, we need to switch the network to Sepolia and get test tokens on Sepolia.
Click on the Metamask wallet plug-in, log in to the MetaMask wallet,
open the testnet in the settings, and switch to Sepolia.

We can then claim test tokens at the link below.

AMOUNT: 0.5/24 Hours

Finally, make sure your network is switched to Sepolia and has at least 0.1 SepoliaETH.
