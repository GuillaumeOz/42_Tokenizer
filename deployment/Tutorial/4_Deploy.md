### 4. Deploy an ERC-721 Smart Contract

After the compilation is successful, it is time to deploy your compiled ERC-721 smart contract to the Sepolia test network.
Go to the "Depoly & Interaction" module, select the contract you want to deploy in the compiled smart contract, and deploy it.

In this tutorial, we will use the GameItem smart contract for deployment.

After the deployment is successful, you can see a message in the output section indicating that your smart contract has been successfully deployed.
You can also verify deployed smart contracts on the Sepolia testnet. In the "INTERACT" panel, you can see all the functions of the deployed smart contract.
