### 6. Create a flattened file using the flattener library

To verify a smart contract that imports other smart contracts, we need to create a flattened file,
a flattened file including all the source codes of imported contracts in a single file.
To create a flattened file, you need to activate a "Flattener" plug-in from the "PLUGIN Manager" panel.

Once the Flatterner plug-in is activated, you'll be able to access it as a separate module, as shown in the figure below. Choose **GameItem.sol**,
and click on the flatten button to create a flattened file; once the flattened file is created, it will be automatically copied to the clipboard;
you may paste it to a file and save it for later usage.

If you want to save the flattened file, click the save button, and a flattened file will be saved in the current repository.

The saved flattened file can be accessed under the "Explorer" panel.
