# TOKENIZER : 42x42 NFT

## Overview
**"42x42"** is an NFT collection inspired by "HunterXHunter", specifically the "Greed Island" arc. The project encapsulates a series of digital cards, each representing a unique asset within the "42x42" universe.

## Choice of Blockchain: Ethereum
We have opted for the Ethereum blockchain due to its wide adoption and support for the ERC-721 standard, which is ideal for representing unique digital items as NFTs. Ethereum's extensive development tools and active community make it a robust platform for our project.

## Development Environment and Tools
To develop our "42x42" NFT smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, we have selected ChainIDE as our primary development environment. ChainIDE is a powerful cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports multiple blockchain platforms and languages, including Solidity for Ethereum. This tool provides a seamless development experience with features like real-time feedback, debugging, and version control.

By leveraging ChainIDE, we ensure that our development process is efficient and accessible from anywhere, without the need to set up a local development environment. This approach allows our team to focus on writing high-quality, secure smart contracts for the "42x42" NFT collection.

ChainIDE also integrates well with the Ethereum test networks, enabling us to test our NFTs thoroughly before deploying them to the mainnet. The use of ChainIDE represents our commitment to using cutting-edge tools to deliver a robust and innovative NFT experience.

## Understanding ERC-20 vs ERC-721 Tokens

### `ERC-20 Tokens`
ERC-20 is a standard for fungible tokens, which means each token is identical and interchangeable with any other token of the same type. This fungibility makes ERC-20 tokens perfect for creating cryptocurrencies or any digital assets where each unit holds the same value and properties as another.

### `ERC-721 Tokens`
On the other hand, ERC-721 defines a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where each token is unique and has distinct characteristics. This uniqueness is crucial for representing ownership of specific assets like digital art, collectibles, or in our case, the "42x42" digital cards. Each ERC-721 token can carry individual metadata that may include attributes, ownership history, and other identifiers that distinguish one token from another.

### Why `ERC-721` for "42x42" NFTs?
For the "42x42" project, we chose the ERC-721 standard due to its ability to ensure the uniqueness and rarity of each digital card. Unlike ERC-20 tokens, which are interchangeable and could represent currency, ERC-721 tokens allow us to create a digital representation of a collectible card that is one-of-a-kind. This aligns perfectly with the concept of collecting rare cards in the "42x42" game, where each card has its own identity and value, much like physical collectible cards. By leveraging the ERC-721 standard, we can guarantee that when someone owns a "42x42" NFT, they hold something distinctive and irreplaceable in the digital realm.
